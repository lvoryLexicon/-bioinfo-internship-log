My internship scripts and notes in bioinformatics lab

### 7.8 - Density Plot & Outlier Detection
- Read large .txt file with 79,000+ rows
- Calculated difference between two columns
- Removed outliers using quantile and 3-sigma rules
- Plotted density graph using ggplot2
- Learned data structure inspection with summary(), str(), etc.

### 7.9 - GO Enrichment Analysis with Barplot and Lollipop Plot
- This R script performs Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis based on differential gene expression results, and visualizes the top enriched - GO Biological Process terms using a barplot with color gradient and a lollipop-style annotated chart.
- Preprocess gene list: Remove Ensembl version suffix
